# ðŸ¦ ðŸ”° Covid-19 API (Brazil)
[PortuguÃªs](https://github.com/jvdutra/covid-19-br-api/blob/master/README.md)

Since the federal government of Brazil changed its methods to share the numbers of the Covid-19 of Brazil, I made this API that scraps the coronavirus statistics from every* state health department website.

It's configured to web scrap every day at 10:00 PM and save the results into a MySQL database.

Some features will be added soon, like filtering results.

Please note that the focus of this project is not to develop a professional or production-ready application.

###### * Not every. Currently, only 16 of 26 states have working source websites, you can see them by navigating to ``src/scrapper/sources.json``.
